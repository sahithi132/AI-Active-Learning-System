# 🧠 AI Active Learning System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Labeling large datasets is costly and time-consuming.

## 💡 Solution
This prototype demonstrates an Active Learning approach where only selected data points are labeled under a fixed budget.

## ⚙️ Approach
- Simulated dataset of 1000 samples
- Budget-based sampling
- Iterative labeling process

## 🤖 ML + GenAI Integration
- ML: Active learning sampling logic
- GenAI: Can be integrated for smart annotation or data labeling assistance

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python app.py
